- row against previous workouts
- adjust the workout display (long press to choice from distance, duration, strokes, energy, speed, pulse, stroke rate, stroke ratio, time, split, average split, delta distance, delta duration)
- export your workout to TCX (Training Center XML) to import it into your favorite fitness tracking App or service.
- export your workout to your calendar
- export your workout to Google Fit (experimental)
- read heart rate from your Waterrower, Android sensor or a connected Bluetooth LE/Ant+ device
